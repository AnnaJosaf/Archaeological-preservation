# Archaeological-preservation, heritage digitization studies step by step
*Archaeological Preservation -
-Survey and Assessment- Identify and survey archaeological sites or artifacts to determine their significance, condition, and preservation needs.
-Documentation- Document the site or artifact through detailed notes, sketches, measurements, and photographs.
-Conservation Planning- Develop a conservation plan outlining strategies to protect and preserve the site or artifacts.
-Conservation Interventions- Implement conservation techniques such as stabilizing structures, removing contaminants, or applying protective coatings to prevent further decay.
-Monitoring and Maintenance- Regularly monitor the site or artifacts to assess their condition and implement necessary maintenance.

# Heritage Digitization Studies
-Selection of Items for Digitization- Choose artifacts, documents, or sites based on their historical significance and preservation needs.
-Digitization Techniques- Employ various digitization methods such as 3D scanning, photogrammetry, or laser scanning to create accurate digital representations of the selected items.
-Data Processing- Process the captured data to create high-quality digital models or replicas.
-Archiving and Database Creation- Organize and archive the digitized data in a systematic manner, creating databases that facilitate easy access and retrieval for researchers and the public.
